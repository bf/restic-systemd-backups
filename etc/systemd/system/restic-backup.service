# All restic environment variables are defined in /root/restic-backup.env
EnvironmentFile=/root/restic-backup.env

## Main Backup logic
# The "ExecStart" statements are the main backup logic.
# We can have as many "ExecStart" statements as we want,
# they will be processed sequentially.

# 1) Backup of PostgreSQL database (careful: special syntax when using pipes!)
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c 'pg_dumpall -U postgres | restic backup --verbose --stdin --stdin-filename postgresql-database.dump.sql'

# 2) Backup of git repository
ExecStart=restic backup --verbose /home/user/my-git-repository.git

## Post-Backup logic
# The "ExecStartPost" clean up after the backup is done.
# We can have as many "ExecStartPost" statements as we want,
# they will be processed sequentially.

# 3) Forget unneeded backups according to policy
ExecStartPost=restic forget --verbose --prune --group-by "paths" --keep-daily $RETENTION_DAYS --keep-weekly $RETENTION_WEEKS --keep-monthly $RETENTION_MONTHS --keep-yearly $RETENTION_YEARS --keep-hourly $RETENTION_HOURS

# 4) Copy local backups to offsite location
ExecStartPost=rsync -aHrv $RESTIC_REPOSITORY $RSYNC_TARGET

# 5) Forget unneeded backups in offsite location according to policy
ExecStartPost=restic forget -r "sftp:${RSYNC_TARGET}" --verbose --prune --group-by "paths" --keep-daily $RETENTION_DAYS --keep-weekly $RETENTION_WEEKS --keep-monthly $RETENTION_MONTHS --keep-yearly $RETENTION_YEARS --keep-hourly $RETENTION_HOURS
